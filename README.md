# tourism_website
I developed a website using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. It is a Responsive website, with attractive user-interface, where user can see multiple options to book a trip to vacation.
To create this responsive website i've taken help of css Selector with which when we hover over the text we're able to change the color of the text.
With the help of html video element i was able to add videos in the home page as shown and when click on the video-slider button in the bottom-center of the home page we can play different video's.
